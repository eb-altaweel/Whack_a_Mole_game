1. Create game elements:
   - Multiple holes (where the mole can appear)

   - Reset score to 0
   - Reset timer to 30 seconds
   - Start two intervals:
     - One for randomly popping up moles
     - One for counting down the game timer

4. In the mole interval (e.g., every 800msâ€“1000ms):
   - Hide the mole from all holes
   - Randomly select one hole
   - Display the mole in that hole

5. When the player clicks on a mole:
   - Increase the score by 1
   - Update the score display
   - Hide the mole immediately

6. In the countdown interval (every 1 second):

   - Update the timer display
   - If the timer reaches 0:
